comitup.conf \-\- Comitup configuration file format
.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[I]comitup.conf\f[] file configures the wifi management service
comitup(8).
It is located in the \f[I]/etc/\f[] directory.
.SS PARAMETERS
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]base_name\f[]: By default, comitup will create a hotspot named
\f[B]comitup\-<nnnn>\f[], and publish avahi\-daemon(8) host entries for
\f[B]comitup\-<nnnn>\f[] and \f[B]comitup\f[].
Setting this entry will change the \f[B]comitup\f[] string with one of
the users choosing.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]web_service\f[]: This defines a user web service to be controlled
by \f[B]comitup\f[].
This service will be disabled in the \f[B]HOTSPOT\f[] state in
preference of the comitup web service, and will be enabled in the
\f[B]CONNECTED\f[] state.
This should be the name of the systemd web service, such as
\f[I]apache2.service\f[] or \f[I]nginx.service\f[].
This defaults to a null string, meaning no service is controlled.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]enable_appliance_mode\f[]: By default, comitup will use multiple
wifi interfaces, if available, to connect to the local hotspot and to
the internet simultaneously.
Setting this to something other than "true" will limit comitup to the
first wifi interface.
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[I]external_callback\f[]:
.RS 2
.PP
The path to an external script that is called on comitup state changes.
It will include a single argument, either \[aq]HOTSPOT\[aq],
\[aq]CONNECTING\[aq], or \[aq]CONNECTED\[aq].
The script will run as the owning user and group.
