.SS DESCRIPTION
.PP
The \f[B]comitup\-cli\f[] utility provides access to the comitup(8)
D\-Bus interface.
It is intended to serve as a debug tool, and a source code example for
connecting to the interface.
.PP
If the comitup(8) service is not running, \f[B]comitup\-cli\f[] will
immediately exit.
.PP
Display:
.IP \[bu] 2
\f[B]State\f[]
.RS 2
.PP
The \f[B]comitup\f[] states are \f[B]HOTSPOT\f[], \f[B]CONNECTING\f[],
and \f[B]CONNECTED\f[].
.PP
In the \f[B]HOTSPOT\f[] mode, \f[B]comitup\f[] creates a wifi hotspot
with the name \f[B]comitup\-<nnnn>\f[], where <nnnn> is a persistent
4\-digit number.
.PP
Once in \f[B]HOTSPOT\f[] mode, the system will occasionally (~1/min)
cycle through available defined connections, by transitioning to the
\f[B]CONNECTING\f[] mode.
The Access Point list is updated by this process.
Any command issued by \f[B]comitup\-cli\f[] will cause the next timeout
instance to be skipped.
.PP
Once a connection is established, the system will be in the
\f[B]CONNECTED\f[] mode.
If the connection is lost, failed, or deleted, the system will
transition back to the \f[B]HOTSPOT\f[] state.

.PP
While in the \f[B]HOTSPOT\f[] mode, \f[B]comitup\-cli\f[] will list the
currently\-visible access points, by \f[C]ssid\f[].
Access points with the strongest signal are sorted to the top of the
list.
The entries are numbered, for use with the \f[B]connect\f[] command.
